         "description":"Cosmetic dentistry is generally used to refer to any dental work that improves the appearance (though not necessarily the functionality) of teeth, gums and/or bite. It primarily focuses on improvement in dental aesthetics in color, position, shape, size, alignment and overall smile appearance.[1] Many dentists refer to themselves as cosmetic dentists regardless of their specific education, specialty, training, and experience in this field. This has been considered unethical with a predominant objective of marketing to patients.[2] The American Dental Association does not recognize cosmetic dentistry as a formal specialty area of dentistry.[3] However, there are still dentists that promote themselves as cosmetic dentists."

Abnormal alignment of the teeth and jaws is very common. Nearly 50% of the developed world's population, according to the American Association of Orthodontics, has malocclusions severe enough to benefit from orthodontic treatment.[citation needed]: although this figure decreases to less than 10% according to the same AAO statement when referring to medically necessary orthodontics."
